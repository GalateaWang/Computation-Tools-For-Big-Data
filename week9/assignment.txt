Exercise 1:

Write a Spark job to count the occurrences of each word in a text file. 
Document that it works with a small example.

Exercise 2:

Write a Spark job that determines if a graph has an Euler tour (all 
vertices have even degree) where you can assume that the graph you get 
is connected. This file 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/usdi0wpsqm3jb7f/eulerGraphs.txt?dl=0 has 5 
graphs â€“ for each graph, the first line tells the number of nodes N and 
the number of edges E. The next E lines tells which two nodes are 
connected by an edge. Two nodes can be connected by multiple edges.

It is fine if you split the file into 5 different files. You do not need 
to keep the node and edge counts in the top of the file.

Document that it works using a small example.

Exercise 3:

You are given a couple of hours of raw WiFi data from my phone: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/964gq5o5bkzg7q3/wifi.data?dl=0

Compute the following things using Spark:

1. What are the 10 networks I observed the most, and how many times were 
they observed? Note: the bssid is unique for every network, the name 
(ssid) of the network is not necessarily unique.
2. What are the 10 most common wifi names? (ssid)
3. What are the 10 longest wifi names? (again, ssid)
