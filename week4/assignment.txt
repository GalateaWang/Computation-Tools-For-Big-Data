Exercise 4.1:

Implement the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to work with Jaccard-distance 
as its metric. It should be able to handle sparse data.

We suggest that you implement the DBSCAN clustering algorithm as 
described in the Wikipedia article, linked to above. The algorithm 
should use Jaccard-distance (1 minus Jaccard index) when measuring 
distance between points. In this exercise two points that are exactly a 
distance epsilon apart are taken to be in the same cluster, thus 
greater-than-or-equal dist(a, b) <= epsilon and not dist(a, b) < epsilon 
should be used.

Your method should support a large number (~100,000) of sparse points in 
very high-dimensional space (~100,000 dimensions). This means that the 
points – even though they lie in very high dimensional space – only have 
few non-zero coordinates.
