Exercise 2.1:

Write a script with two methods. The first method should read in a 
matrix like the one here and save it as an array of arrays. The second 
method should do the inverse, namely save an array of arrays to a file. 
The methods should take the file name as a parameter from the command 
line.

Exercise 2.2:

Write a script that takes an integer N, and outputs all bit-strings of 
length N as lists. For example: 3 -> [0,0,0], 
[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]. As a sanity 
check, remember that there are 2^N such lists.

Exercise 2.3:

Write a script that takes this file (from this Kaggle competition), 
extracts the request_text field from each dictionary in the list, and 
construct a bag of words representation of the string (string to 
count-list).
