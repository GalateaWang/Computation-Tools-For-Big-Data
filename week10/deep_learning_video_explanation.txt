Explain in your own words what Deep Learning is.
       Deep learning is a multi-layered approach to designing an algorithm. Its basis consists of a feedback system, where weights for nodes are generated, and then modified based on learning input. The modifications are determined by the differences between the input and the output, which are calculated using a loss function. Similarly, those differences are optimized using an optimization function. As a result, the parameters change until the output produced matches the data provided.
       This kind of approach is useful for situations in which it is important to find a pattern, or representation, of a data set. As a result, deep learning is most frequently used directly on media processing to find patterns such as personalized recommendations of entertainment, signal processing, and anomaly detection. The anomaly detection is able to determine, for example, where a tumor is simply by analyzing an X-Ray image and searching for irregularities. The algorithm begins on a very low level, and working up a hierarchical structure. In facial recognition systems, for example, on the lowest level, the program is able to conduct edge detection. One step higher, it combines those edges to have feature detection. The system can continue by joining those features to form the idea of a human face, and then recognize that face is various positions.
       One problem regarding deep learning is that the computational intensity is so high. It takes enormous amounts of RAM to make the necessary computations for the learning, including the optimization of the entire network. Ultimately, however, the concept is very powerful and will lead to countless innovations for the human race.
