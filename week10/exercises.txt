Exercise 1:

Start by watching the following video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVkSY0GYWXY

Explain in your own words what Deep Learning is.

Should be between 100 and 500 words.

Exercise 2:

Read the following tutorial: 
http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/

Explain in your own words what a Convolutional Neural Network is.

Should be between 200 and 500 words.

Exercise 3:

In this exercise you will be using the Caffe Deep Learning framework to 
classify a picture of a cat, and a picture of your own choosing. We have 
provided a virtual machine (through vagrant) that has Caffe installed.

Download this Vagrantfile
Start the virtual machine by running vagrant up in the folder where you 
saved the Vagrantfile. (Note: You may get a bunch of “default: Warning: 
Remote connection disconnect. Retrying...“-messages, these can be 
ignored. Just wait a minute or two, then go to the next step)
Go to http://localhost:8003 in your browser. This should open an 
iPython/Jupyter notebook.
Open the file 00-classification.ipynb in the iPython/Jupyter notebook. 
Follow and run the steps in the notebook until the block titled “How 
long did it take”.
Find your own test picture, and upload it to the virtual machine via 
iPython/Jupyter. The file is then available in the directory 
/home/vagrant/caffe/examples. Try classifying your own test picture in 
the notebook (this can be done simply by changing the path to the cat 
image used to the file you just uploaded).
Show your results for both the default cat picture and your own choice 
of picture in the report. How well does it perform?
